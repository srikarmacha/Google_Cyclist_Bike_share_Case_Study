This project is a part of Google Data Analytics Certification course Capstone Project. As a Data Analysts we need to apply our skills which we have learned throughout the course and come up with a solution to solve the business problem facing by a company Cyclistic. 
Problem Statement
Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. As a junior data analyst, I need to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently and come with an insight to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

**Ask Phase**

>Identify the business task

How do annual members and casual riders use rental bikes differently?

>Key Stakeholders

Lily Moreno : The director of marketing and my manager , Cyclistic executive team and Cyclistic marketing analytics team.


**Prepare Phase**

In this Project we will be using Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. This is public data that we can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license. 
There are no issues of bias or credibility with the above datasets. I found that data is reliable, original, comprehensive, current, and cited.

**Process Phase**

The primary tools which I have been used for cleaning the data was R. I have uploaded the datasets into R and figured out some concerns which I need to need to rectify in this phase. You can find my R Analysis file [here](https://github.com/srikarmacha/Google_Cyclist_Bike_share_Case_Study/blob/70d3936805232a4ed5f73c8a21102e51b12f7d29/Data_Analysis.R).

1.	Need to remove duplicate rows.
2.	Removed rows with null values .
3.	Altered the variable names.
4.	Created a new column for calculating the ride length of each ride.
5.	Need to main the consistency between the column names and match the data types of every column with respective dataset.


**Analyze and Share** 

Combine the data from the multiple datasets and make a resultant data set where we need to perform some calculations and conduct descriptive analysis.
1.	We need to make the columns names are unique and consistent.
2.	Filter the columns by removing the unwanted columns.
3.	Calculate the ride length.
4.	Calculate the average ride time by each day of members vs casual riders
5.	Comparing  members and casual users 


I have visualized the above data set using Tableau. You can find the link [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/GoogleDataAnalyticsCapstoneProject_16613537263150/Monthly_Ridelength?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
